I came out lookin' to party,
and now I'm ownin' that building
You bitches can't get my spot
until I start raisin' some children
These bitches all in they feelings, can't fuck with Nicki,
they know it
They know that Nicki a poet, pop me a bottle of MoÃ«t
They said I couldn't, but I did it though
Tell 'em I still got that hourglass figure though
Can't stop me, don't watch me
You better just watch your nigga, ho, I'm in that big boy
I am in beast mode, respect the G-code
Bitches ain't got drive, these bitches will get repo'd
I am a monster, this is ambition
This the type of car, that you keep a bad bitch in
Not that I don't got good vision,
but I don't see competition
They want me to come and help them,
but I am not a magician
I'm on them fo-fours, I'm tippin',
you better move out my way
I am not here to play, Pinkprint can't be delayed

Cause I win again, cause I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, yeah I win again
Can't tell me nothin' about it, your opinion is invalid
Go against me, then you made a mistake
